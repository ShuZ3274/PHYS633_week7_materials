# Week 7: Chaos and Long-term Dynamics of the Solar System

## Reading
- Chapter 9 from [Murray and Dermott](https://mcgill.on.worldcat.org/search/detail/40857034?datasource=library_web&search_field=all_fields&search=true&database=all&scope=wz%3A12129&format=&clusterResults=on&func=find-b&q=&topLod=0&queryString=solar%20system%20dynamics&find=Go), sections 9.1-9.4 inclusively
- Section 5 from Duncan and Quinn 'The Long-Term Dynamical Evolution of the Solar System'

## Reading questions

Q1-4 are related to the first reading, Q5-7 to the second.

1. Before reading, give a definition of what you think chaos is, then update it as you go through the reading.
2. (a) How does the existence of the Jacobi constant reduce the dimensionality of phase space in the circular restricted three-body problem, and why is this reduction essential for constructing a Poincaré surface of section? (b) What’s the physical meaning of a jacobi surface?
3. What do the islands in Fig 9.5 symbolize physically and what happens when we place the starting condition further from the center of the island that straddles $\dot{x} =0$?
4. What is the maximum Lyapounov characteristic exponent and what does it tell you?
5. (coming soon)
